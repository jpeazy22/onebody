I started off with CG Games Individual in 2022 reaching the semi-finals to finally winning the CG Games Teams Division 50 + last year. I'm 60 this year and feel like I'm in the best shape I have ever been. It is because of the socials, fun workout games and the community aspect that I continue with Gabe as my trainor.",

I joined his outdoor bootcamp classes over a year ago, as I was approaching the big 5-0, after nearly two decades without regular exercise. Since then, I've been attending his classes 4-5 times a week, and I can honestly say I look forward to them each time. When you join One Body, you join a community of people of different ages and physical abilities that support each other. His approach is motivating and empowering, pushing me beyond what I thought possible while ensuring proper technique and safety. Thanks to his guidance, I've not only regained my fitness, but surpassed my own expectations. I feel stronger, healthier, and more energized than ever before. If you're looking for a trainer who will challenge and inspire you to reach your goals, look no further than Gabriel. I couldn't recommend him highly enough.",
